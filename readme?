Demo: 

General operation:
Pro+ TimedPinger sends a timestamped ping to Op station:12000, op station logs the timestamp, how long it took to get there (latency), the source ip:port, and the message. 

Then, the op station responds with an "ack" (simulating response data) to port 1543 that includes the original timestamp -- allowing for latency tracking for the round trip

This simulates general communication between two systems (only 2 for now because the 3rd machine will be the attacker in this scenario).

The app station machine is the attacker. This machine targets the Pro+ machine by preforming a UDP Flood attack on port 1543, sending so many UDP packets that the Pro+ machine ends up dropping the op station's response packets. This behavior demonstrates a successful DoS attack, causing the droppage of data. 


________________________________________________

Pro+ has a timed pinger program, simulating the client program that allows user input, sending 1 "ping" every second

Each ping or message in general has a timestamp attached to it, allowing for latency tracking. 


Op Station has a relatively basic role right now.
